  <p align="left">
    A minimalist homepage for your emotions. 
  
  Nearly 20% of americans report seeing a therapist, including me! One thing Iâ€™m always asked is to keep a journal, but I just can never do it. Thatâ€™s where emo-check comes in. 
  
  Its minimalistic design is the perfect replacement for your current homeage, and it includes an easy-to-submit form and emotion selector where you can say as little or as much as you want to!
  You can then view the history of your emotions in a chart and their corresponding journal submissions. 
  
  <strong>Warning</strong>! It might look like the stock market sometimes, but its actually your own personal emotional rollercoaster ðŸ˜….
  
  emo-check was built with <em>React</em>, <em>Material-UI</em>, <em>React Router</em>, <em>Express.js</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>MongoDB</em>, and <em>Chart.js</em>. 
  
  It is deployed using <em>Heroku</em> and <em>Mongo Atlas</em>
